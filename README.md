## About

In Theory Games is building the world's first MMOGG (Massive Multiplayer Online Gambling Game).

The Keynesian Beauty Contest is built on the Inco Network using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). FHE allows for computation on encrypted inputs which unlocks novel game mechanics not previously possible on-chain. For more information on the Inco Network and FHE please see their [docs](https://docs.org/introduction/inco-network-introduction).

In Theory Games is an [@0xAkrasia](https://twitter.com/0xAkrasia) and [@cryptitalk](https://twitter.com/cryptitalk) project. If you want to contribute please reach out to Akrasia on Twitter. We are actively looking for talented developers, game designers, and UI/UX team members.
